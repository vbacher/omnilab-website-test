By developing computational tools, the OMNI Lab aims to address key needs in modern medicine: (i) automated analysis relieves the requirement for highly-skilled radiologists; (ii) discovery of novel markers for diagnostic screening; (iii) software for portable devices, thus broadening access to high-quality care in the developing world; and (iv) investing in sophisticated software while leveraging existing imaging hardware provides a large cost benefit to an already constrained healthcare system. To achieve these goals, our research focuses on the following topics:

- Characterising the Fetal Brain
- ⁠⁠2D-3D US Reconstruction
- Clinical Translation
- ⁠⁠Deep Learning Methodology
