# Welcome to the Oxford Machine Learning in NeuroImaging Lab

### Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford

We are an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to advancing the understanding of early brain development through the integration of machine learning and neuroimaging. Our work focuses on developing data-efficient, scalable methods to extract clinically relevant information from ultrasound: the most widely used, and often only available, imaging modality in pregnancy care worldwide.

Our goal is to enable high-resolution, quantitative analysis of fetal brain development from routine clinical scans. By leveraging large-scale population datasets and collaborations across clinical and computational sciences, we aim to both improve scientific understanding of early brain maturation and develop practical tools for use in diverse healthcare settings.

## Research areas

**Fetal Brain Maturation**
Modelling brain development trajectories from 14 weeks gestation using large-scale ultrasound datasets.

**Model Compression**
Creating lightweight neural networks for real-time analysis on portable devices.

**2D-to-3D Reconstruction**
Employing neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to generate volumetric brain images from standard 2D ultrasound videos.

**Federated Learning**
Training privacy-preserving models across multiple clinical sites without data sharing.

**Neurodevelopmental Outcomes**
Linking prenatal imaging features to postnatal cognitive and behavioral assessments.
