I am currently reading for a DPhil in Computer Science at the University of Oxford in the [Oxford Machine Learning in NeuroImaging Lab (OMNI)](https://oxford-omni-lab.github.io). I am supervised by Dr. Ana IL Namburete, based at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk). I am currently funded by the [Clarendon Fund](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon). Prior to starting my PhD, I studied medical engineering with a strong focus on medical image processing at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) for my BSc. as well as my MSc. Parallel to my MSc in Biomedical Engineering, I also pursued a double degree in Computational Engineering at FAU and the Università della Svizzera italiana.
My research interests evolve around computervision applied to medical imagae data. I have previously wored with Computed tomographies on 2D to 3D reconstruction an motion correction as well as sparse reconstruction and metal segmentation. I was also interested in incorporating known operators such as Pack projection into neural networks. My current research focuses on differentiable ultrasound simulation and arthefact reduction in ultrasound images. I am also looking into the fetal brain development.
